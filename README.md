# TuxML
## MLfood.py script
### Goal

`MLfood.py` is the first command to run on your host machine.

At the beginning, it will ask you the super user privileges in order to run docker.

This script is used to fill the DataBase which "feed" the Machine Learning algorithm and allows to start automatically the `tuxml.py` command on different dockers by calling the script `tuxLogs.py` which write output.log.

`./MLfood <Integer>` will start n docker sequentially, each docker run `tuxlogs.py` which run `tuxml.py`

### How to use ?

Command should be :

    ./MLfood.py <Integer> [<Integer>] [Options]

    Example : ./MLfood 50 5 --dev

This example will run 50 docker, each one will run 5 compiling in incremental mode, on the developpement docker image ("--dev").

```
A simple run command could be:

./MLfood 100

```

It will start 100 compiling sequentially on the functionnal docker image.

```
  The first Integer run MLfood into the given number of containers
  The second Integer is optional, it is used in a case of incremental compiling with <Integer> number of compiling in a container.
  The default number of compiling in a container is set as 1
  Options: --no-clean    Do not delete used containers
           -h, --help    Prompt Options
           --reset-logs  Delete all the saved logs
           --dev         Use images in current developpement
```

The script retrieves the logs file err.logs, std.logs and output.logs as well as the `.config` file generated in the RandConfig command in the Logs/ folder thanks to `tuxLogs.py`.

`MLfood.py` now use "tee" to create the output.logs from `tuxLogs.py` to prompt the output and create the `output.logs` which is the tuxml.py's one.

See `tuxLogs.py`

```
usage: MLfood.py [-h] [-b BRANCH] [-i IMAGE] [--no-clean] [-V] [-v {0,1,2}]
                 NB_DOCKERS

positional arguments:
  NB_DOCKERS            number of dockers to launch, minimum 1

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -b BRANCH, --branch BRANCH
                        choose which  version of TuxML to  execute between
                        master and dev
                          master : last stable version (default)
                          dev    : last up-to-date version
  -i IMAGE, --image IMAGE
                        two kinds of images are available
                          prod : TuxML is  already included in the docker image.
                                 This is the fastest way. (default)
                          dev  : download  TuxML repository  from  GitHub before
                                 starting the compilation
  --no-clean            do not clean containers
  -V, --version         display the sampler version and exit
  -v {0,1,2}, --verbose {0,1,2}
                        increase or decrease output verbosity
                          0 : quiet
                          1 : normal (default)
                          2 : chatty
```

## tuxml.py script
### Goal
The TuxML's goal is to automatically compile Linux kernel sources in order to build
a database for a machine learning algorithm. If the compilation crashes, TuxML analyzes the error log file to determine the causes.

There are two possible ways:  

* it is a missing  package : TuxML will install it and  resume the compilation
* the error can't be fixed : the compilation stops

If the compilation is a success, TuxML launch a kernel boot test.

Then it sends the results to the TuxML database.

You can run TuxML independantly from the MLfood.

### How to use ?
```
usage: tuxml.py [-h] [-v {1,2,3,4}] [-V] [-c NB_CORES] [-d KCONFIG]
                [--incremental NINC] [--database {prod,dev,alexis}]
                source_path

positional arguments:
  source_path           path to the Linux source directory

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v {1,2,3,4}, --verbose {1,2,3,4}
                        increase or decrease output verbosity
                          1 : very quiet
                          2 : quiet
                          3 : chatty (default)
                          4 : very chatty
  -V, --version         display TuxML version and exit
  -c NB_CORES, --cores NB_CORES
                        define  the  number  of CPU  cores  to  use  during  the
                        compilation. By default  TuxML  use all  the  availables
                        cores on the system.
  -d KCONFIG, --debug KCONFIG
                        the KCONFIG_FILE given.
  --incremental NINC    incremental  mod does  not  erase  files  from  previous
                        compilations. The  NINC  parameter  corresponds  to  the
                        number of incremental compilation to launch.
  --database {prod,dev,alexis}
                        choose on which database send the compilation results
```

## TPDIM.py

### Goal
This script/program is design to help people using TuxML to easly manage there docker image or container.

### How to use ?
You have to use few command to build and push :
* Build : ``` ./TPDIM -b [IMAGE_NAME : debian] -t [TAG_NAME : dev/prod]```
* Push : ``` ./TPDIM -p [IMAGE_NAME : debian] -t [TAG_NAME : dev/prod]```
* Generation : Use only when update Dockerfile or when adding new dependences to the image ``` ./TPDIM -g [IMAGE_NAME : debian] -dep dependences.txt -t [TAG_NAME : dev/prod]```
