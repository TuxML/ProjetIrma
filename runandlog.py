# @brief Run compilations and update database with logs.
#
# @details This is the program that execute tuxLogs.py in order to run all the compilations
# expected in this container and create the file output.log which contain the complete system output of compilation process.
# This new file output.log is sent to the database through an "UPDATE Compilations SET output_file = %s WHERE cid = %s" command in SQL.
#
# When MLfood.py is called with 10 compilations and 3 as incremental parameter, runandlog is one of the 10 compilations asked,
# which run 1 basic compilation then the 3 incremental compilations.
# The script is run with the command : "./runandlog.py 3" to run 3 incremental compilation in addition to the basic one
