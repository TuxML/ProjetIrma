# @brief Recompile with differents kernel compressions
#
# @details Running this script is only to rewrite .config with a different compression set up
# you need to choose between different compressions methods then it will be enable in the .config file
# the second effect is to disable other compressions that could be enable. If GZIP was enable and
# you choose BZIP2, then GZIP will be disable and commented, BZIP2 will be set at "y".
# It take place in the "harvesting data" part to gather different size about kernel compressions.
