# @brief File used to start a given number of compilation with a given number of core
#
# @details This file was created to gain data on specific parameters of compilations, here it is used to
# perform a compilation on several machine where each one compile with a different number of cores, genconf.py has been used to
# generate 100 .config, all the machine will run tuxml.py with a different number of cores on the same 100 .config.
# With this, we can make some calculation and predictions on what would be the behavior to compile a .config file with 1 core and an
# 4 core. The objective is to see is there are correlations between options in the Linux Kernel or if an other factor than hardware
# affect compilations.
# All machine used to perform the same .config needs to be the same ( Same configurations, hardware ).

# ExecConfig.py, Fetch.py and genconf.py are NOT USEFUL in the TuxML Project.
