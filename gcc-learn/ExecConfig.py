# @brief File which start tuxml.py with specific parameters
#
# @details This script works almost like tuxLogs.py, it is used to execute tuxml.py with the number of cores given by Fetch.py.
# The program runs tuxml.py with a given number of cores, and configure it to send the compilations data to an other database used
# to make correlations as it was said in Fetch.py with the help of Machine Learning.

# ExecConfig.py, Fetch.py and genconf.py are NOT USEFUL in the TuxML Project.
